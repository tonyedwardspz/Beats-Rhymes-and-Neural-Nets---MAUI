Frankenstein is a friend of mine
But even Frankie is afraid of what the fans will find
If they go into my mind and try to unwind
All the cobwebs, hotheads, slime and grime

I’m a ticking ticking time bomb, chitty chitty bang bang
Everybody in the city get it like a gang bang
Imma bring the pain pain, drop it like its rain rain
When they ask who done it we don’t gotta play the blame game

I’m a godzilla, nobody rhymes illa
I’m hotter than the goblin in the bottom of your liquor
Now you’re ‘bout to pass out, about to be a blackout
Wishing you could take it back, but ain’t no way to back out

Probably better anyway that you will not be witnessing
Mortality, brutality, fatality, finish him!
Tried the medication, turned to meditation
Every building I see i think needs a renovation

I bring it to ground with a king kong pound
Watch the people bounce around like a ping pong round
Suspected I’m dyslexic but I'm still gonna haunt you
Told you futha muckers I’m a motha loving monster.
