title: Coup de Graƒçe
---

I've been looking around, but I still haven't found my place
That's why you see me drift off in to outer space
And all you down-to-earth speakers spinning all your plates 
you're in a state. . . pshh. I think your slides are out of date 

Rock up to your meet-up an hour late
Sneak in like "Hey folks it's sounding great" 
I swear to God I hear another of you welterweight
speakers here who sound the same there'll be all of hell to pay 

I'm feeling back in my element
Like I'm channeling your panel, write a talk for the hell of it
Dignitries get reminded that I'm actually talented
I don't want to but I have to keep telling them

I can pad my talk out with slides that are six years old
'Cause I built better decks than you when I was six years old
And all you speakers from the new school who've just enrolled
If you don't know that I'm the shit then you've just been told
