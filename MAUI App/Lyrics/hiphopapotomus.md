title: Hiphopopotamus vs Rhymenoceros

They call me the Hip-Hopapotamus
Flows that glow like phosphorous
Poppin' off the top of this esophagus
Rockin' this metropolis
I'm not a large water-dwelling mammal
Where did you get that preposterous hypothesis?
Did Steve tell you that, perchance?
Mmmph, Steve
